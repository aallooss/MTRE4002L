# MTRE4002L-LAB0

This repository's purpose is for me to keep this project organized.

## Usage

You will find two source files types, '.m' and '.slx'. The former is standard MATLAB code and the latter is Simulink, which strictly needs MATLAB to view and edit.

## Collaboration
This repository is not intened to be a collaboration but only for me to better organize my projects.
